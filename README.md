### Description

A wonderful tool that extracts Attachment Out of any Outlook folders and dumps them into any folder in your hard-disk. I developed this tool out of necessity when I had to find a way to extract image attachment from an ad campaign from more than 1000 mails!! This application has made my life easy and now I can parse through the attachment without opening the mails!!
